# Openapi 3.0 documentation for Application lifecycle management APIs.

- _EdgeCloudApi.yaml_
  - Full API spec. Use for tooling as it is too big for human readability.

- _groups/*.yaml_
  - APIS broken into groups for human readability. Each yaml file is a separate standalone openapi doc, but may have redundant information with other files.
